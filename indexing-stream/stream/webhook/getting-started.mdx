## Webhook

Mobula provides Webhook support for retrieving any raw events and curated events like Swaps or Liquidity.

### Product demo

Coming soon.

### Endpoint details

- URL: https://stream.zobula.xyz/api/1/webhooks
- Body (json):

```json
{
    "name": "MyFirstWebhook",
    "chainIds": ["evm:1", "evm:56"],
    "events": ["trace", "log", "trasaction", "block", "swap"],
    "apiKey": "xxxxxxxxxx",
    "url": "https://webhook.com/xxxxxxxxxxx",
};
```

### Parameters

- chainIds: [details here](/blockchains/intro-blockchains)
- events: transactions, traces, logs, blocks, swaps
- filters: [details here](/indexing-stream/stream/filters)
- webhookUrl: URL to send the data

### Create a webhook

First we need to create a webhook:

```typescript
await fetch(url, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: {
  "name": "FirstWebhook",
  "chainIds": ["evm:1"],
  "events": ["trace"],
  "apiKey": "xxxxx",
  "filters": {
    "eq": ["action.input", "0xd55ec697"]
  },
  "url": "https://webhook.com/xxxxx"
  }
});
```

<Tip> The API key is mandatory to create a webhook. </Tip>

If you receive data from your webhook in response, then your webhook is functional and will start receiving events.

### Delete a webhook

To delete a webhook:

```typescript
await fetch(url + `/${webhook_id}`, {
      method: 'DELETE',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
    });
```

If you receive: 

```json
{
    "message": "Webhook deleted successfully"
}
```

Then your webhook is deleted.
