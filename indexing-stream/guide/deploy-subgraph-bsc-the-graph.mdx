title: "Deploy an Indexer (Subgraph) on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) with The Graph"
description: "Step-by-step guide on deploying a subgraph on BNB Smart Chain using using The Graph for optimized blockchain data indexing."
---

Deploying a subgraph on BSC with Mobula’s infrastructure is a simple process. This guide will take you through the steps to get your subgraph running on the BNB Smart Chain network.

### What you’ll need

- Fundamental understanding of The Graph and subgraphs.
- Your subgraph project files ready.
- The Graph CLI installed
- A Mobula API key (for authentication)

### Walkthrough

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Your Subgraph">
    Make sure your subgraph is configured for BNB Smart Chain. Update your `subgraph.yaml` file to point to BSC-specific contracts and events. If you don’t have a subgraph, you can clone the Uniswap V2 (PancakeSwap) subgraph template and customize it for BSC:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MobulaFi/univ2-subgraph-bsc
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    Make sure you have The Graph CLI installed:

    ```bash
    npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build Your Subgraph">
    Compile your subgraph before deployment:

    ```bash
    graph codegen && graph build
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the Subgraph">
    Use the following command to deploy your subgraph:

    ```bash
    graph create --node https://subgraph.mobula.io:8020
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy to Mobula's BNB Smart Chain Node">
    Use the following command to deploy your subgraph:

    ```bash
    graph deploy --node https://subgraph.mobula.io:8020 --ipfs https://subgraph.mobula.io:5001 --network bnbsmartchain
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate">
    When asked, enter your Mobula API key for authentication. For further details on acquiring and using your API key, refer to the [authentication section](<https://docs.mobula.io/indexing-stream/authentification>).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Deployment">
    Following deployment, you’ll be provided with a URL to track your subgraph’s indexing progress and status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Best Practices

- Keep your subgraph regularly updated to ensure it remains compatible with the latest BNB Smart Chain network changes.
- Thoroughly test your subgraph on a testnet before deploying to the mainnet.
- Continuously monitor its performance and optimize queries for greater efficiency.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment:

- Review your `subgraph.yaml` configuration.
- Confirm that you're using the correct network name and Mobula node URLs.
- Ensure your API key is valid and has the required permissions.
