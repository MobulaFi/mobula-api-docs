title: "Deploy an Indexer (Subgraph) on zkSync with The Graph"
description: "Step-by-step guide for deploying a subgraph on zkSync using The Graph for efficient blockchain data indexing and querying."
---

Setting up a subgraph on zkSync with Mobula's infrastructure is an easy process. This tutorial will guide you through each step to get your subgraph operational on the zkSync network.

### What you’ll need

- Basic knowledge of The Graph and subgraphs.
- Your subgraph project files
- The Graph CLI installed
- A Mobula API key (for authentication)

### Walkthrough

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Your Subgraph">
    Configure your subgraph for zkSync. Adjust your `subgraph.yaml` file to reference zkSync-specific contracts and events. If you don't have a subgraph yet, you can clone the Uniswap V2 (zkSwap) subgraph template and tailor it for zkSync:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MobulaFi/univ2-subgraph-zksync
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    Make sure you have The Graph CLI installed:

    ```bash
    npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build Your Subgraph">
    Compile your subgraph before deployment:

    ```bash
    graph codegen && graph build
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create the Subgraph">
    Use the following command to deploy your subgraph:

    ```bash
    graph create --node https://subgraph.mobula.io:8020
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy to Mobula's zkSync Node">
    Use the following command to deploy your subgraph:

    ```bash
    graph deploy --node https://subgraph.mobula.io:8020 --ipfs https://subgraph.mobula.io:5001 --network zksync
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate">
    When requested, input your Mobula API key for authentication. Check the [authentication section](https://docs.mobula.io/indexing-stream/authentification) for detailed instructions on obtaining and using your API key.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Deployment">
    After deployment, you’ll receive a URL to monitor your subgraph’s indexing progress and status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Best Practices

- Ensure your subgraph is consistently updated to stay compatible with the latest zkSync network changes.
- Perform thorough testing on a testnet before deploying to the mainnet.
- Regularly monitor its performance and optimize queries for improved efficiency.

### Troubleshooting

If you face issues during deployment:

- Review your `subgraph.yaml` file carefully.
- Ensure the network name and Mobula node URLs are correct.
- Check that your API key is valid and has the appropriate permissions.
