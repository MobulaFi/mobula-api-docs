title: "Deploying an Indexer (Subgraph) on zkLink with The Graph"
description: "Step-by-step guide on deploying a subgraph on zkLink using using The Graph for optimized blockchain data indexing."
---

Deploying a subgraph on zkLink Nova using Mobula's infrastructure is a straightforward process. This guide will walk you through the steps to get your subgraph up and running on the zkLink network.

### What you'll need

- Basic knowledge of The Graph and subgraphs
- Your subgraph project files
- The Graph CLI installed
- A Mobula API key (for authentication)

### Walkthrough

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Your Subgraph">
    Ensure your subgraph is configured for zkLink Nova. Update your `subgraph.yaml` file to reference zkLink-specific contracts and events. If you don't have any subgraph, you can clone the Uniswap V2 (Linkswap) subgraph template and modify it for zkLink:
    
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MobulaFi/univ2-subgraph-zklink
```
  </Step>
 

  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    Make sure you have The Graph CLI installed
```bash
npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli
```
  </Step>
  
  

  <Step title="Build Your Subgraph">
    Compile your subgraph before deployment
```bash
graph codegen && graph build
```
  </Step>


  <Step title="Create the Subgraph">
    Use the following command to deploy your subgraph
```bash
graph create --node http://subgraph.mobula.io:8020
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy to Mobula's zkLink Node">
    Use the following command to deploy your subgraph
```bash
graph deploy --node http://subgraph.mobula.io:8020 --ipfs http://subgraph.mobula.io:5001 --network zklink
```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Authenticate">
    When prompted, provide your Mobula API key for authentication. Refer to the [authentication section](/indexing-stream/authentification) for more details on obtaining and using your API key.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Deployment">
    After deployment, you'll receive a URL to monitor your subgraph's indexing progress and status.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Best Practices

- Regularly update your subgraph to ensure compatibility with the latest zkLink Nova network changes.
- Test your subgraph thoroughly on a testnet before deploying to mainnet.
- Monitor your subgraph's performance and optimize queries for efficiency.

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues during deployment:

- Double-check your `subgraph.yaml` configuration.
- Ensure you're using the correct network name and Mobula node URLs.
- Verify your API key is valid and has the necessary permissions.
