### Basics

Mobula allows you to query assets with:

- The name (not case sensitive) of the asset from Mobula’s curated dataset explorable on the [/all endpoint](/api-reference/endpoint/all) and on [Mobula App](https://mobula.io)
- The symbol (not case sensitive) of the asset from the same dataset
- The contract address of the asset if any, with the need to add (if the asset isn’t part of mobula’s curated dataset) the blockchain ID or blockchain name (blockchains list can be found [here](/blockchains/intro-blockchains))

### Query details

Assets queries are broke down in multiple parameters:

- `asset` which contains the name OR the address of the asset
- `blockchain` only useful if asset is passed as a contract address
- `symbol` if the asset name/address isn’t known

### Examples

Querying Bitcoin with name: [market/data?asset=Bitcoin](https://api.mobula.io/api/1/market/data?asset=Bitcoin)

Querying LINK with symbol: [market/data?symbol=LINK](https://api.mobula.io/api/1/market/data?symbol=LINK)

Querying LINK with contract address: [market/data?asset=0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca&blockchain=1](https://api.mobula.io/api/1/market/data?asset=0x514910771af9ca656af840dff83e8264ecf986ca&blockchain=1)

### Conflicts resolution

Multiple assets might have the same name or symbol - if you’re using name/symbols to fetch Mobula’s dataset, Mobula’s engine will always sort by market cap to pick the largest asset that matches your queries.
